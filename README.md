### Bodyline drills (~5-10min)
Fire up your core and reinforce proper positions

* Do NOT Rest between the bodyline drills. Just move to the next one with minimal
rest.

* It's important to note that these bodyline drills are not meant to be
progressed. Simply do one hold for as long as you can hold (somewhat)
comfortably and move on. Once you can hold it for 60s, simply keep it like
that.

* It also important to note that the warm-up can and should be modified if you
have particular 'problem areas' or 'tight areas' that may need special
attention.

* If you're not feeling warmed up yet, do 10-20 burpees or squat jumps.

### Skill Work (~10 minutes)
**Instructions**: Set a timer for 5-10 minutes and go practice your support and handstand, resting as necessary. When time's up, move to the strength work.

**Prerequisite**: If you are not able to plank for at least 30 seconds yet, skip the handstand practice for now.

### Support hold

* Strength Work

## 4-6 progression exercises, paired to save time.

### Pair:

* Push up: Wall -> Incline -> Floor -> Diamond -> Pseudo Planche
* Rows: Vertical Rows -> Incline Rows -> Horizontal rows

* L-sit: Foot supported -> One foot -> Tucked -> Full L-sit (Each progression buildup from 3x10s to 3x30s)
* Squat: Assisted Squats -> Regular Squats -> Step up -> Deep Step up

* Dips: (Prerequisite: 3x8 Diamond push up)
* Pull ups: (Prerequisite: 3x8 Horizontal rows)

### How to do a pair:
* One set of push up -> 90s -> One set of Rows -> 90s
* One set of push up -> 90s -> One set of Rows -> 90s
* One set of push up -> 90s -> One set of Rows -> 90s
